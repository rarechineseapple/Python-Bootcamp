# Python-Bootcamp
Python bootcamp challenge for 50 days / 100 days.

This repository is simply a "journal" of sorts for me to upload my daily challenges. I seek to use this bootcamp as a 
refresher for myself and at the same time freshen up on new concepts. Thank you for reading.


## Missing days?
Sometimes I feel that a project/challenge can be further improved on from the basic functionality it provides, thus I
won't add it in. For instance, my day 4 project, I am planning to further work on it to develop it into a desktop
executable. 

Day 5 and Day 6 are not part of the repository because I was checking out [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html).<br />
I will add my solutions into the respective files for Day 5 and 6 eventually.
